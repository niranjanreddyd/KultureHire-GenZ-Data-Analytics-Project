 Clearly identify the essential materials (like solvents and catalysts) and their costs. 

Develop a simple spreadsheet to compare the costs of different processes against the expected selling price of the product. 

Choose one or two processes that have the best chance of success, both commercially and technically. 

Start with desk-level analysis to model reactions, then move to bench-level experiments to validate those models in the lab. 

Keep detailed records of all experiments, including materials used and conditions, to learn from any discrepancies between theory and practice.

Use the results from the lab to refine our approach, making adjustments based on what works and what doesn’t.

By following these steps, we can add structure to our R&D process and minimize unnecessary spending.
